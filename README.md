### Project Description
SkillHER is a women-only skill exchange platform designed to create a safe, supportive ecosystem where women can offer skills, request skills, and collaborate through mutual learning.
The platform enables peer-to-peer skill swapping without monetary transactions, focusing on empowerment, accessibility, and confidence-building.

### The Problem statement
Many women possess valuable skills but lack visibility and structured opportunities to share them.
At the same time, many women want to learn new skills but face barriers such as:
High course fees
Competitive environments
Lack of beginner-friendly platforms
Absence of women-focused networking spaces
Existing platforms like LinkedIn and Fiverr are primarily career-driven or monetized, making them less accessible for collaborative, non-commercial skill exchange.
There is currently no dedicated platform that enables women to exchange skills freely within a secure and empowering environment.

### The Solution
SkillHER introduces a structured skill-swap ecosystem where:
Users register with skills they offer and skills they want to learn
The system identifies mutual skill matches
Users can send and manage swap requests
Collaboration happens without financial pressure

The platform prioritizes:
Free access
Ease of use
Beginner-friendly participation
Women-centered community building
